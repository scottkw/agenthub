# AgentHub

## What This Is

A cross-platform desktop app (macOS, Linux, Windows) for running AI coding CLIs — Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, Gemini CLI, and others — in tabbed terminal sessions powered by xterm.js. Built with Go/Wails for the backend and React for the frontend. Every session can be served over the web via Tailscale with browser-trusted Let's Encrypt TLS, accessible from any tailnet device via URL or QR code — no passwords, no tokens, no certificate setup. Health checks detect Tailscale state and guide users through setup with platform-specific instructions. Live status indicators show whether each CLI is running, waiting, or errored. Includes a polished UI with tabbed settings, per-tab font sizing, new-session modal with agent picker and folder browser, tab renaming with web dashboard propagation, and a cross-platform build script with macOS signing support.

## Core Value

One app to launch, manage, and share AI coding terminal sessions across local and remote access — with zero manual setup for web serving, TLS, or session persistence.

### Active

**Current Milestone: v1.3 CLI + Daemon**

**Goal:** Extract session management into a persistent background daemon with full CLI control; GUI and CLI are both clients that attach to the same session pool.

**Target features:**
- Background daemon managing all sessions, surviving client disconnects and reboots (launchd/systemd/Windows service)
- Single binary, two modes: `agenthub` (GUI) / `agenthub <command>` (CLI)
- Full CLI command set: new, list, attach, detach, kill, rename, web start/stop/status, serve/unserve, health, qr, settings
- Interactive terminal attach: full PTY proxy with raw I/O, resize events, ctrl-c passthrough
- Configurable detach prefix key
- Shared sessions: GUI and CLI see the same session pool, attach/detach independently
- Daemon auto-start on login via platform service managers

### Out of Scope

- Mobile app — desktop and web access only; PWA via web serving covers mobile needs
- AI coding CLI installation — app checks for CLIs but doesn't install them
- Tailscale/VPN installation or management — user handles VPN setup separately
- End-to-end encryption beyond TLS — Tailscale's Let's Encrypt certs are sufficient
- User account system with registration — Tailscale network membership is the access control
- Cloud hosting or SaaS deployment — this is a local-first desktop app
- Plugin system for adding new CLIs — initial set is hardcoded, extensibility is future scope
- Session output search / replay — tools like agent-sessions serve this niche
- Split panes / tiling within a tab — each AI session gets its own tab
- Configurable session backend (tmux vs Go-native) — deferred to future milestone
- Real tmux mode with `tmux attach` — deferred to future milestone
- Per-session token expiry and revocation — removed: tokens deleted in v1.2
- Non-Tailscale VPN support — removed in v1.2; Tailscale-only networking
- Tab color coding per CLI type — deferred to future milestone
- Status heuristic patterns for non-Claude CLIs — deferred to future milestone
- Font/theme customization beyond size — per-tab font size covers the immediate need

## Context

Shipped v1.2 with ~8,846 LOC (5,364 Go + 2,550 TS/TSX + 932 CSS). Net LOC decreased from v1.1 due to auth/VPN code removal.
Tech stack: Go/Wails v2, React, xterm.js, nhooyr/websocket, go-pty, skip2/go-qrcode, tailscale.com/client/local.
Frontend test suite: vitest tests (source-inspection pattern for xterm.js/Wails constraints).
Go test suite: race-clean, webserver tests with function injection for Tailscale health checks.
Networking: Tailscale-only — Let's Encrypt certs via daemon, FQDN-based URLs, no auth layer.
Status heuristics implemented for Claude CLI; other CLIs always show "running" (deferred).
Build script: `build.sh` compiles for macOS/Linux/Windows with optional macOS signing/notarization.

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Go backend (Wails), React frontend, xterm.js for terminals
- **Single binary**: Wails compiles to a single distributable binary per platform
- **No cloud dependency**: Everything runs locally — no external services required
- **Cross-platform**: Must work on macOS, Linux, and Windows from day one

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Go/Wails over Electron | Smaller binary, better performance, native Go ecosystem for PTY/tmux | ✓ Good — single binary ~15MB, fast startup |
| xterm.js for terminal rendering | Industry standard, well-maintained, used by VS Code terminal | ✓ Good — full ANSI/Unicode support, scrollback works |
| Go-native PTY only for v1 (tmux deferred to v2) | Reduce scope; Go-native covers all v1 use cases | ✓ Good — simplified architecture, no tmux dep |
| Same Go process serves desktop + web | Simpler architecture, single port management, shared session state | ✓ Good — session sharing works seamlessly |
| Self-signed TLS → Tailscale Let's Encrypt | Phase 15 switched to Tailscale certs; self-signed CA removed | ✓ Good — no CA install needed, browser-trusted by default |
| Tailscale network = access control | Phase 16 removed password + tokens; only tailnet members can reach the server | ✓ Good — simpler, no auth UI/middleware to maintain |
| go-pty (aymanbagabas) over creack/pty | Windows ConPTY support required from day one | ✓ Good — cross-platform PTY with single API |
| Binary framing protocol for WS relay | Distinguishes output/resize/input frames; enables scrollback replay | ✓ Good — clean separation of message types |
| Native macOS cgo NSStatusBar for tray | fyne.io/systray conflicts with Wails AppDelegate (duplicate symbol) | ⚠️ Revisit — platform-specific code, Linux/Windows stubs needed |
| ResizeObserver + requestAnimationFrame for fit() | Handles all layout changes, not just window resize | ✓ Good — fixed terminal height issues |
| ?raw source-inspection tests for xterm.js components | jsdom lacks Canvas/WebGL; runtime mocking xterm is fragile | ✓ Good — stable tests that verify code structure without DOM |
| JSX conditionals over CSS display toggle | Consistent pattern across StatusBar, SettingsPanel tabs | ✓ Good — cleaner React patterns, easier to test |
| build.sh with Docker for Linux cross-compile | No native Linux WebKitGTK headers on macOS | ✓ Good — portable Linux builds from any OS |
| ditto (not zip) for notarization archive | Preserves macOS extended attributes required by notarytool | ✓ Good — correct signing pipeline |
| `local.Client{}` zero-value for Tailscale daemon | Queries existing tailscaled via Unix socket; no tsnet, no embedded daemon | ✓ Good — minimal dependency, no second Tailscale node |
| In-process Unix socket before process separation | Phase 19 validates the module boundary and protocol without fork complexity | ✓ Good — full test coverage of API contract; Phase 20 changes only socket path |
| CreateSession calls engine directly (not client) | onStatus callback wraps runtime.EventsEmit — callbacks can't serialize over HTTP | ✓ Good — clean exception, documented in code |
| Function injection for health checks (`statusFunc`) | Enables daemon-free unit testing without mocks or interfaces | ✓ Good — fast, deterministic tests |
| `GetCertificate` hook (not cached CertPair) | Dynamic cert provisioning; certs always fresh from daemon | ✓ Good — no stale cert bugs, no disk writes |
| FQDN from `CertDomains()[0]` (not hardcoded) | Machine name auto-derived from Tailscale daemon | ✓ Good — zero configuration for users |
| CT disclosure via sentinel file | One-time acknowledgment persisted as `ct_disclosed` file | ✓ Good — simple, no database needed |
| Tailscale health gates web server startup | Server refuses to start without healthy Tailscale state | ✓ Good — clear error path, no partial failures |
| Safety dependency chain (health→TLS→auth removal→cleanup) | Each phase's deletion is safe only after the prior phase confirms the replacement works | ✓ Good — zero regressions across 5 phases |
